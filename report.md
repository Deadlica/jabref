## Project

Name: JabRef

URL: https://github.com/JabRef/jabref

It is a reference and citation management tool built in java.

## Onboarding experience
We started with an android app project that converts images to PDF but their documentation was very limited and running it out of the box didn't work for us. We also realized that we might need to have Android Studio installed as well to run it which we thought was a hassle and therefore we switched project.

JabRef provided extensive documentation on how to setup up a fork of the repository locally to get started with contributing. In their guide they gave instructions on how to set it up using IntelliJ which led us to also download IntelliJ for the setup. They included how to build the project, run tests and adding a code style checker to ensure that contributions follows their coding style. For the build they also documented which JDK was needed for it to run and any extra components would be installed by gradle when building. The build and tests ran on the first attempt without any issues.


## Complexity



1. What are your results for five complex functions?
   * Did all methods (tools vs. manual count) get the same result?
   * Are the results clear?
2. Are the functions just complex, or also long?
3. What is the purpose of the functions?
4. Are exceptions taken into account in the given measurements?
5. Is the documentation clear w.r.t. all the possible outcomes?

## Refactoring

Plan for refactoring complex code:

Estimated impact of refactoring (lower CC, but other drawbacks?).

Carried out refactoring (optional, P+):

git diff ...

## Coverage

### Tools

Document your experience in using a "new"/different coverage tool.

How well was the tool documented? Was it possible/easy/difficult to
integrate it with your build environment?

### Your own coverage tool

Show a patch (or link to a branch) that shows the instrumented code to
gather coverage measurements.

The patch is probably too long to be copied here, so please add
the git command that is used to obtain the patch instead:

git diff ...

What kinds of constructs does your tool support, and how accurate is
its output?

### Evaluation

1. How detailed is your coverage measurement?

2. What are the limitations of your own tool?

3. Are the results of your tool consistent with existing coverage tools?

## Coverage improvement

Show the comments that describe the requirements for the coverage.

Report of old coverage: [link]

Report of new coverage: [link]

Test cases added:

git diff ...

Number of test cases added: two per team member (P) or at least four (P+).
